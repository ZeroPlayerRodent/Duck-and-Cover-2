## Building

Build the source code with [Firecracker](https://github.com/ZeroPlayerRodent/firecracker) and load the binary on a Commodore 64 emulator.

## How To Play

Move joystick 1 up to select a game mode.

Hold fire on joystick 1 for 2 seconds to start/restart the game.

Move the joystick left and right to move your duck.

Repeatedly tap fire to flap your wings and fly.

If you flap your wings too much you will run out of stamina and start falling.

Land on platforms to regain stamina.

Avoid rockets/explosions, and survive as long as possible to score points.
